            <img src="A.png" height="500px" style="border-width: 50px; border-color: royalblue; border-style: ridge;">

            <h2 style="text-align: left;">What makes a car Supercar?</h2>
            <p style="text-align: left;">The obvious answer is speed, both in terms of top speed and acceleration.
                In a
                hierarchy that begins with sports cars and ends with hypercars, supercars are the high-performance
                middle, featuring vehicles that are more than capable of tearing up the track and leaving common
                sports
                cars in the dust.

                There are no broadly agreed demarcations on the term supercar, though. Some have cited a mid-engine
                requirement, but that would leave several high-performing front-engined models — such as the Ferrari
                F12berlinetta — out of the mix in a way that doesn’t make sense. Analyzing the feel behind the wheel
                and
                the use of unique technologies to enhance the driving experience could also play a role, as could
                other
                aspects of the vehicles such as power-to-weight ratio. Price and scarcity may also be relevant — but
                these things are often subjective.

                Perhaps what matters to many is the nameplate of the vehicle itself. In that regard, brands like
                Ferrari

                are synonymous with both supercars and hypercars.</p>

            <h2 style="text-align: left;">The Difference Between a Supercar and a Sports Car.</h2>
            <p style="text-align: left;">What classifies a supercar as something more than a garden-variety sports
                car is often going to be a
                question of degree. Common sports cars are often graceful, high-performing vehicles, but when
                questioning the difference between supercars and sports cars, the supercar will always win out. How
                fast
                is the vehicle and what level of aerodynamic engineering is at play? Even things like price and
                availability may be factors.

                Once upon a time, American muscle cars were considered supercars in some quarters, but nowadays,
                nobody
                is going to confuse a comparatively humble Ford Mustang with a Ferrari F8 Tributo. Similarly, a
                Porsche
                911 is significantly more common than a Ferrari Portofino, which will lead some to call the 911 a
                sports
                car and the Portofino a supercar due to limited production numbers. What’s under the hood also plays
                a
                role, of course — but the point, again, is that there is subjectivity in the term.</p>
